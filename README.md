# CrowdQuests
by Happy Goats

CrowdQuests is a game modeled on Pokemon Go that makes it fun to verify and improve the accuracy of open government data and real world assets.

Transform your free time to challenge your neighbourhood, friends or family into a real world treasure hunt! Claim ultimate victory and win real world prizes while you improve open data for everyone!

Federal, State, Territory and Local Governments have been doing an awesome job of releasing more and more data for public use. This is a great thing! However, the sheer volume of the released data means that it’s difficult to keep up-to-date. Data audits can take heaps of time and are very costly to government and of course, taxpayers.

CrowdQuests was brought to life over the weekend of GovHack 2018 by Jayen, Ken, Richard and Yvonne with help from John.

To play with the early version of CrowdQuests or to organise your own data audit or challenge head over to https://crowdquests.com/
